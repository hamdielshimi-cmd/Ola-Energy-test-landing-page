# Code Quality Standards

- **Commenting:** Add comments to explain the "why" behind complex code sections, not the "what."
- **Naming Conventions:** Use descriptive names. Use `camelCase` for JavaScript variables/functions and `kebab-case` for CSS classes.
- **Modularity:** Write CSS and JS in a way that is organized and easy to understand. Group related styles and functions.
