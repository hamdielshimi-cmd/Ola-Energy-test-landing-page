# Core Design, UX, and Conversion Principles

## 1. Narrative-Driven Scroll (The Journey)
Every page must tell a story, progressing logically from a problem to a solution. The visual design and animations must support this narrative journey.

## 2. User-Centric Design (Clarity & Usability)
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Guide the user's eye with deliberate use of size, color, and whitespace. The most important element should be the most prominent.
- **Minimalism:** If an element doesn't serve a purpose in telling the story or driving an action, remove it. Avoid clutter.

## 3. Cinematic Animation
- **Purposeful Motion:** Animation is used to enhance the story, not for decoration. Use it to introduce elements, create focus, and provide a premium feel.
- **Scroll-Triggered:** Animations should be tied to the user's scroll to make the page feel interactive and alive.

## 4. Accessibility (WCAG Compliance)
- **Alt Text:** All `<img>` tags must have descriptive alt text.
- **Color Contrast:** Ensure text has sufficient contrast against its background to be easily readable.
- **Semantic HTML:** Use proper HTML5 tags (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`) to give the page structure.

## 5. Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)
- **Clear Call-to-Action (CTA):** The primary CTA should be obvious, compelling, and visually distinct.
- **Frictionless Forms:** Forms should be simple, with the minimum number of fields required.
